Headless Raspberry Pi
======================

The idea is to stand up a headless raspberry pi that you can ssh into and do things on.

Requirements
============

This has only been tested on MacOS, but there is no reason it shouldn't work on *nix.

nmap
---

```bash
brew install nmap
```

```bash
nmap --open -sT -p T:22 192.168.86.0/24

arp -na | grep -i b8:27:eb
```

Instructions
============

If you will run this on Wifi (not ethernet), start
from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) to configure the WiFi on your
raspberry pi. However, if you can connect to ethernet, I would recommend doing so, and you can skip this step.

As per [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md) add an empty `ssh` file to the root
partition when you frist boot up.

Locally run the following. This will find and add your Pi to the local ssh config.

```bash
./find_pi.py
```

ssh into it,

```bash
ssh raspberrypi
```

On there, you should [**change your
password**, update locale, etc](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md)

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Also ensure that ssh runs on start up

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
